# Template for a PhD progress report

Suitable for a PhD progress report (also known as Part-A). Very similar to the
format of a Bachelor's project (30 pages limit).

Tip for nice compilation:
```
latexmk -pvc parta_master.tex
```

Change the `latexmkrc`-file if you need `shell-escape` for code-inclusion.
