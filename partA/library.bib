abstract = {We have shown that data-driven models are effective for inferring physical attributes of stars (labels; Teff, logg, [M/H]) from spectra, even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. Here we explore whether this is possible when the dimensionality of the label space is large (Teff, logg, and 15 abundances: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) and the model is non-linear in its response to abundance and parameter changes. We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding {\~{}}50{\%} of the observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend this work to other spectroscopic surveys.},

abstract = {Standard solar models (SSMs) provide a reference framework across a number of research fields: solar and stellar models, solar neutrinos, particle physics the most conspicuous among them. The accuracy of the physical description of the global properties of the Sun that SSMs provide has been challenged in the last decade by a number of developments in stellar spectroscopic techniques. Over the same period of time, solar neutrino experiments, and Borexino in particular, have measured the four solar neutrino fluxes from the pp-chains that are associated with 99$\backslash${\%} of the nuclear energy generated in the Sun. Borexino has also set the most stringent limit on CNO energy generation, only {\$}\backslashsim 40\backslash{\%}{\$} larger than predicted by SSMs. More recently, and for the first time, radiative opacity experiments have been performed at conditions that closely resemble those at the base of the solar convective envelope. In this article, we review these developments and discuss the current status of SSMs, including its intrinsic limitations.},

abstract = {I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z{\~{}}6 down to galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z{\~{}}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z{\~{}}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z{\textgreater}1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

@article{Ness2015,
abstract = {New spectroscopic surveys offer the promise of consistent stellar parameters and abundances ('stellar labels') for hundreds of thousands of stars in the Milky Way: this poses a formidable spectral modeling challenge. In many cases, there is a sub-set of reference objects for which the stellar labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the 'known' labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars. We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19 clusters as reference objects, with Teff, log g and [Fe/H] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of 56,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good labels even at one ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar labels.},

abstract = {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A newly designed 1-D stellar evolution module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. Independently usable modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own public interface. Examples include comparisons to other codes and show evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets; the complete evolution of a 1 Msun star from the pre-main sequence to a cooling white dwarf; the Solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate mass stars through the thermal pulses on the He-shell burning AGB phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the pre-main sequence to the onset of core collapse; stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and accretion onto a neutron star.

@article{Tak2017,
abstract = {The well-known Bayes theorem assumes that a posterior distribution is a probability distribution. However, the posterior distribution may no longer be a probability distribution if an improper prior distribution (non-probability measure) such as an unbounded uniform prior is used. Improper priors are often used in the astronomical literature to reflect on a lack of prior knowledge, but checking whether the resulting posterior is a probability distribution is sometimes neglected. It turns out that 24 articles out of 75 articles (32$\backslash${\%}) published online in two renowned astronomy journals (ApJ and MNRAS) between Jan 1, 2017 and Oct 15, 2017 make use of Bayesian analyses without rigorously establishing posterior propriety. A disturbing aspect is that a Gibbs-type Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method can produce a seemingly reasonable posterior sample even when the posterior is not a probability distribution (Hobert and Casella, 1996). In such cases, researchers may erroneously make probabilistic inferences without noticing that the MCMC sample is from a non-existent probability distribution. We review why checking posterior propriety is fundamental in Bayesian analyses when improper priors are used and discuss how we can set up scientifically motivated proper priors to avoid the pitfalls of using improper priors.},

Radiative hydrodynamic simulations of solar and stellar surface convection have become an important tool for exploring the structure and gas dynamics in the envelopes and atmospheres of late-type stars and for improving our understanding of the formation of stellar spectra. Aims: We quantitatively compare results from three-dimensional, radiative hydrodynamic simulations of convection near the solar surface generated with three numerical codes (CO5BOLD, MURaM, and Stagger) and different simulation setups in order to investigate the level of similarity and to cross-validate the simulations. Methods: For all three simulations, we considered the average stratifications of various quantities (temperature, pressure, flow velocity, etc.) on surfaces of constant geometrical or optical depth, as well as their temporal and spatial fluctuations. We also compared observables, such as the spatially resolved patterns of the emerging intensity and of the vertical velocity at the solar optical surface as well as the center-to-limb variation of the continuum intensity at various wavelengths. Results: The depth profiles of the thermodynamical quantities and of the convective velocities as well as their spatial fluctuations agree quite well. Slight deviations can be understood in terms of differences in box size, spatial resolution and in the treatment of non-gray radiative transfer between the simulations. Conclusions: The results give confidence in the reliability of the results from comprehensive radiative hydrodynamic simulations.},

abstract = {Core helium burning primary red clump (RC) stars are evolved red giant stars which are excellent standard candles. As such, these stars are routinely used to map the Milky Way or determine the distance to other galaxies among other things. However distinguishing RC stars from their less evolved precursors, namely red giant branch (RGB) stars, is still a difficult challenge and has been deemed the domain of asteroseismology. In this work, we use a sample of 1,676 RGB and RC stars which have both single epoch infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey and asteroseismic parameters and classification to show that the spectra alone can be used to (1) predict asteroseismic parameters with precision high enough to (2) distinguish core helium burning RC from other giant stars with less than 2{\%} contamination. This will not only allow for a clean selection of a large number of standard candles across our own and other galaxies from spectroscopic surveys, but also will remove one of the primary roadblocks for stellar evolution studies of mixing and mass loss in red giant stars.},

abstract = {Based on detailed 2D numerical radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) calculations of time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied the dynamics and thermal structure of the convective surface layers of solar-type stars. The RHD models provide information about the convective efficiency in the superadiabatic region at the top of convective envelopes and predict the asymptotic value of the entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified layers. This information is translated into an effective mixing-length parameter alpha suitable to construct standard stellar structure models. We validate the approach by a detailed comparison to helioseismic data. The grid of RHD models for solar metallicity comprises 58 simulation runs with a helium abundance of Y=0.28 in the range of effective temperatures 4300K {\textless} Teff {\textless} 7100K and gravities 2.54 {\textless} logg {\textless} 4.74. We find a moderate, nevertheless significant variation of alpha between about 1.3 for F-dwarfs and 1.75 for K-subgiants with a dominant dependence on Teff. In the close neighbourhood of the Sun we find a plateau where alpha remains almost constant. The internal accuracy of the calibration of alpha is estimated to be +/- 0.05 with a possible systematic bias towards lower values. An analogous calibration of the convection theory of Canuto {\&} Mazzitelli gives a different temperature dependence but a similar variation of the free parameter. For the first time, values for the gravity-darkening exponent beta are derived independently of mixing-length theory: beta=0.07...0.10. We show that our findings are consistent with constraints from stellar stability considerations and provide compact fitting formulae for the calibrations.},

abstract = {The Magellanic Clouds are surrounded by an extended network of gaseous structures. Chief among these is the Magellanic Stream, an interwoven tail of filaments trailing the Clouds in their orbit around the Milky Way. When considered in tandem with its Leading Arm, the Stream stretches over 200 degrees on the sky. Thought to represent the result of tidal interactions between the Clouds and ram-pressure forces exerted by the Galactic corona, its kinematic properties reflect the dynamical history of the closest pair of dwarf galaxies to the Milky Way. The Stream is a benchmark for hydrodynamical simulations of accreting gas and cloud/corona interactions. If the Stream survives these interactions and arrives safely in the Galactic disk, its cargo of over a billion solar masses of gas has the potential to maintain or elevate the Galactic star formation rate. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge of the Stream, including its chemical composition, physical conditions, origin, and fate. We also review the dynamics of the Magellanic System, including the proper motions and orbital history of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, the first-passage and second-passage scenarios, and the evidence for a Magellanic Group of galaxies.},

abstract = {The space-borne missions have provided us with a wealth of high-quality observational data that allows for seismic inferences of stellar interiors. This requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies, but imperfect modeling of the uppermost stellar layers introduces systematic errors. To overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introduced by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175) and is now commonly used for seismic inferences. Nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing for the quantification of the surface-effect corrections. We used a grid of these simulations computed with the CO{\$}{\^{}}5{\$}BOLD code to model the outer layers of solar-like stars. Upper layers of the corresponding 1D standard models were then replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3D models. The frequency differences between these patched models and the 1D standard models were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us to constrain the Kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a Lorentzian formulation. We find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly on both the effective temperature and the surface gravity. We further provide the variation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections using their power law as well as a Lorentzian formulation. Scaling relations between these parameters and the elevation (related to the Mach number) is also provided. The Lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the whole frequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequency shifts in the frequency range above {\$}\backslashnu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}}{\$}.},

@article{Casagrande2011,
abstract = {We present a re-analysis of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, which benefits from the infrared flux method to improve the accuracy of the derived stellar effective temperatures and uses the latter to build a consistent and improved metallicity scale. Metallicities are calibrated on high-resolution spectroscopy and checked against four open clusters and a moving group, showing excellent consistency. The new temperature and metallicity scales provide a better match to theoretical isochrones, which are used for a Bayesian analysis of stellar ages. With respect to previous analyses, our stars are on average 100 K hotter and 0.1 dex more metal rich, which shift the peak of the metallicity distribution function around the solar value. From Str{\"{o}}mgren photometry we are able to derive for the first time a proxy for [alpha/Fe] abundances, which enables us to perform a tentative dissection of the chemical thin and thick disc. We find evidence for the latter being composed of an old, mildly but systematically alpha-enhanced population that extends to super solar metallicities, in agreement with spectroscopic studies. Our revision offers the largest existing kinematically unbiased sample of the solar neighbourhood that contains full information on kinematics, metallicities, and ages and thus provides better constraints on the physical processes relevant in the build-up of the Milky Way disc, enabling a better understanding of the Sun in a Galactic context.

abstract = {We analyse the effect on adiabatic stellar oscillation frequencies of replacing the near-surface layers in 1D stellar structure models with averaged 3D stellar surface convection simulations. The main difference is an expansion of the atmosphere by 3D convection, expected to explain a major part of the asteroseismic surface effect; a systematic overestimation of p-mode frequencies due to inadequate surface physics. We employ pairs of 1D stellar envelope models and 3D simulations from a previous calibration of the mixing-length parameter, alpha. That calibration constitutes the hitherto most consistent matching of 1D models to 3D simulations, ensuring that their differences are not spurious, but entirely due to the 3D nature of convection. The resulting frequency shift is identified as the structural part of the surface effect. The important, typically non-adiabatic, modal components of the surface effect are not included in the present analysis, but relegated to future papers. Evaluating the structural surface effect at the frequency of maximum mode amplitude, {\$}\backslashnu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}}{\$}, we find shifts from {\$}\backslashdelta\backslashnu{\$}=-0.8 microHz for giants at {\$}\backslashlog g{\$}=2.2 to -35 microHz for a ({\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}=6901{\$} K, {\$}\backslashlog g{\$}=4.29) dwarf. The fractional effect {\$}\backslashdelta\backslashnu(\backslashnu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}})/\backslashnu{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}}{\$}, ranges from -0.1{\%} for a cool dwarf (4185 K, 4.74) to -6{\%} for a warm giant (4962 K, 2.20).},

abstract = {At the dawn of the first discovery of exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars in the mid-1990s, few believed that observations of exoplanet atmospheres would ever be possible. After the 2002 Hubble Space Telescope detection of a transiting exoplanet atmosphere, many skeptics discounted it as a one-object, one-method success. Nevertheless, the field is now firmly established, with over two dozen exoplanet atmospheres observed today. Hot Jupiters are the type of exoplanet currently most amenable to study. Highlights include: detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day-night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure. Atmospheres of giant planets far from their host stars are also being studied with direct imaging. The ultimate exoplanet goal is to answer the enigmatic and ancient question, "Are we alone?" via detection of atmospheric biosignatures. Two exciting prospects are the immediate focus on transiting super Earths orbiting in the habitable zone of M-dwarfs, and ultimately the spaceborne direct imaging of true Earth analogs.},

@article{Stein1998,
abstract = {Numerical simulations provide information on solar convection not available by direct observation. We present results of simulations of near surface solar convection with realistic physics: an equation of state including ionization and three-dimensional, LTE radiative transfer using a four-bin opacity distribution function. Solar convection is driven by radiative cooling in the surface thermal boundary layer, producing the familiar granulation pattern. In the interior of granules, warm plasma ascends with {\~{}}10{\%} ionized hydrogen. As it approaches and passes through the optical surface, the plasma cools, recombines, and loses entropy. It then turns over and converges into the dark intergranular lanes and further into the vertices between granulation cells. These vertices feed turbulent downdrafts below the solar surface, which are the sites of buoyancy work that drives the convection. Only a tiny fraction of the fluid ascending at depth reaches the surface to cool, lose entropy, and form the cores of these downdrafts. Granules evolve by pushing out against and being pushed in by their neighboring granules, and by being split by overlying fluid that cools and is pulled down by gravity. Convective energy transport properties that are closely related to integral constraints such as conservation of energy and mass are exceedingly robust. Other properties, which are less tightly constrained and/or involve higher order moments or derivatives, are found to depend more sensitively on the numerical resolution. At the highest numerical resolution, excellent agreement between simulated convection properties and observations is found. In interpreting observations it is crucial to remember that surfaces of constant optical depth are corrugated. The surface of unit optical depth in the continuum is higher above granules and lower in the intergranular lanes, while the surface of optical depth unity in a spectral line is corrugated in ways that are influenced by both thermal and Doppler effects.},

An occupation probability formalism is used to represent the effects of the plasma in establishing a finite partition function. It is shown that the use of the static screened Coulomb potential to calculate level shifts and to estimate the cutoff of the internal partition function is invalid. For most of the parameter space relevant to stellar envelopes, perturbations arising from the plasma ions are shown to be dominant in establishing the internal partition function.},

abstract = {... [C]urrent stellar models predict oscillation frequencies that are systematically affected by simplified modelling of the near-surface layers. We use three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations to better model the near-surface equilibrium structure of dwarfs with spectral types F3, G2, K0 and K5, and examine the differences between oscillation mode frequencies. ... We precisely match stellar models to the simulations' gravities and effective temperatures at the surface, and to the temporally- and horizontally-averaged densities and pressures at their deepest points. We then replace the near-surface structure with that of the averaged simulation and compute the change in the oscillation mode frequencies. We also fit the differences using several parametric models currently available in the literature. The surface effect in the stars of solar-type and later is qualitatively similar and changes steadily with decreasing effective temperature. In particular, the point of greatest frequency difference decreases slightly as a fraction of the acoustic cut-off frequency and the overall scale of the surface effect decreases. The surface effect in the hot, F3-type star follows the same trend in scale (i.e. it is larger in magnitude) but shows a different overall variation with mode frequency. We find that the two-term fit by Ball {\&} Gizon (2014) is best able to reproduce the surface terms across all four spectral types, although the scaled solar term and a modified Lorentzian function also match the three cooler simulations reasonably well. ... Our simplified results suggest that the surface effect is generally larger in hotter stars (and correspondingly smaller in cooler stars) and of similar shape in stars of solar type and cooler. However, we cannot presently predict whether this will remain so when other components of the surface effect are included.},

abstract = {Relations between temperature, T, and optical depth, tau, are often used for describing the photospheric transition from optically thick to optically thin in stellar structure models. We show that this is well justified, but also that currently used T(tau) relations are often inconsistent with their implementation. As an outer boundary condition on the system of stellar structure equations, T(tau) relations have an undue effect on the overall structure of stars. In this age of precision asteroseismology, we need to re-assess both the method for computing and for implementing T(tau) relations, and the assumptions they rest on. We develop a formulation for proper and consistent evaluation of T(tau) relations from arbitrary 1D or 3D stellar atmospheres, and for their implementation in stellar structure and evolution models. We extract radiative T(tau) relations, as described by our new formulation, from 3D simulations of convection in deep stellar atmospheres of late-type stars from dwarfs to giants. These simulations employ realistic opacities and equation of state, and account for line-blanketing. For comparison, we also extract T(tau) relations from 1D MARCS model atmospheres using the same formulation. T(tau)-relations from our grid of 3D convection simulations display a larger range of behaviours with surface gravity, compared with those of conventional theoretical 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models. Based on this, we recommend no longer to use scaled solar T(tau) relations. Files with T(tau) relations for our grid of simulations are made available to the community, together with routines for interpolating in this irregular grid. We also provide matching tables of atmospheric opacity, for consistent implementation in stellar structure models.},

@article{Haywood2013,
abstract = {We analyze a sample of solar neighborhood stars that have high-quality abundance determinations and show that there are two distinct regimes of [alpha/Fe] versus age, which we identify as the epochs of the thick and thin disk formation. A tight correlation between metallicity and [alpha/Fe] versus age is clearly identifiable for thick disk stars, implying that this population formed from a well mixed interstellar medium, probably initially in starburst and then more quiescently, over a time scale of 4-5 Gyr. Thick disk stars have vertical velocity dispersions which correlate with age, with the youngest objects of this population having small scale heights similar to those of thin disk stars. A natural consequence of these two results is that a vertical metallicity gradient is expected in this population. We suggest that the youngest thick disk set the initial conditions from which the inner thin disk started to form about 8 Gyr ago, at [Fe/H] in the range of (-0.1, +0.1) dex and [alpha/Fe] {\~{}} 0.1 dex. This also provides an explanation for the apparent coincidence between the existence of a step in metallicity at 7-10 kpc in the thin disk and the confinement of the thick disk within R {\textless} 10 kpc. We suggest that the outer thin disk developed outside the influence of the thick disk, giving rise to a separate structure, but also that the high alpha-enrichment of those regions may originate from a primordial pollution of the outer regions by the gas expelled from the forming thick disk. Metal-poor thin disk stars ([Fe/H] {\textless} -0.4 dex) in the solar vicinity, whose properties are best explained by them originating in the outer disk, are shown to be as old as the youngest thick disk (9-10 Gyr). This implies that the outer thin disk started to form while the thick disk was still forming stars in the inner parts of the Galaxy. Hence, while the overall inner (thick+thin) disk is comprised of two structures with different scale lengths and whose combination may give the impression of an inside-out formation process, the thin disk itself probably formed its first stars in its outskirts. Moreover, we point out that, given the tight age-metallicity and age-[alpha/Fe] relations that exist in the thick disk, an inside-out process would give rise to a radial gradient in metallicity and alpha-elements in this population, which is not observed. Finally, we argue that our results leave little room for radial migration (in the sense of churning) either to have contaminated the solar vicinity, or, on a larger scale, to have redistributed stars in significant proportion across the solar annulus.},

abstract = {The scaling relations that relate the average asteroseismic parameters ∆$\nu$ and $\nu$ max to the global properties of stars are used quite extensively to determine stellar properties. While the ∆$\nu$ scaling relation has been examined carefully and the deviations from the relation have been well documented, the $\nu$ max scaling relation has not been examined as extensively. In this paper we examine the $\nu$ max scaling relation using a set of stellar models constructed to have a wide range of mass, metallicity, and age. We find that as with ∆$\nu$, $\nu$ max does not follow the simple scaling relation. The most visible deviation is because of a mean molecular weight effect that is commonly ignored. The remaining deviation is more difficult to address. We find that the influence of the scaling relation errors on asteroseismically derived values of log g are well within uncertainties. The influence of the errors on mass and radius estimates is small for main sequence and subgiants, but can be quite large for red giants.},

The effect of the alpha-element enhancement has been properly taken into account in the nuclear network, opacity, equation of state and, for the first time, the bolometric corrections, and color transformations. This allows us to avoid the inconsistent use - common to all alpha-enhanced model libraries currently available - of scaled-solar bolometric corrections and color transformations for alpha-enhanced models and isochrones. We show how bolometric corrections to magnitudes obtained for the U,B portion of stellar spectra for T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\textless}=6500K, are significantly affected by the metal mixture, especially at the higher metallicities. We also provide complete sets of evolutionary models for low-mass, He-burning stellar structures covering the whole metallicity range, to enable synthetic horizontal branch simulations. We compare our database with several widely used stellar model libraries from different authors, as well as with various observed color magnitude and color-color diagrams (Johnson-Cousins BVI and near infrared magnitudes, Stromgren colors) of Galactic field stars and globular clusters. We also test our isochrones comparing integrated optical colors and Surface Brightness Fluctuation magnitudes with selected globular cluster data. We find a general satisfactory agreement with the empirical constraints.},

abstract = {We present a study of 33 planet-candidate host stars for which asteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to allow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.1{\%} (radius), 1.7{\%} (density), 3.3{\%} (mass), 4.4{\%} (distance), and 14{\%} (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1{\%} in density and radius, and 2{\%} and 7{\%} in mass and age, respectively. We identify the initial helium abundance as a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding an excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

abstract = {The age-metallicity relation of the solar neighbourhood is studied using a sample of 552 late-type dwarfs. This sample was built from the intersection of photometric catalogues with chromospheric activity surveys of the Mount Wilson group. For these stars, metallicities were estimated from uvby data, and ages were calculated from their chromospheric emission levels using a new metallicity-dependent chromospheric activity-age relation developed by Rocha-Pinto {\&} Maciel ($\backslash$cite{\{}RPM98{\}}). A careful estimate of the errors in the chromospheric age is made. The errors in the chromospheric indices are shown to include partially the effects of the stellar magnetic cycles, although a detailed treatment of this error is still beyond our knowledge. It is shown that the results are not affected by the presence of unresolved binaries in the sample. We derive an age-metallicity relation which confirms the mean trend found by previous workers. The mean metallicity shows a slow, steady increase with time, amounting at least 0.56 dex in 15 Gyr. The initial metallicity of the disk is around -0.70 dex, in agreement with the G dwarf metallicity distribution (Rocha-Pinto {\&} Maciel $\backslash$cite{\{}RPM96{\}}). According to our data, the intrinsic cosmic dispersion in metal abundances is around 0.13 dex, a factor of two smaller than that found by Edvardsson et al. ($\backslash$cite{\{}Edv{\}}). We show that chromospheric ages are compatible with isochrone ages, within the expected errors, so that the difference in the scatter cannot be caused by the accuracy of our ages and metallicities. This reinforces some suggestions that the Edvarsson et al.'s sample is not suitable to the determination of the age-metallicity relation.},

This is done for a previously published grid of solar-metallicity convection simulations, covering from 4200 to 6900 K on the main sequence, and from 4300 to 5000 K for giants with log g = 2.2. Our calibration results in an $\alpha$ varying from 1.6 for the warmest dwarf, which is just cool enough to admit a convective envelope, and up to 2.05 for the coolest dwarfs in our grid. In between these is a triangular plateau of $\alpha$ ˜ 1.76. The Sun is located on this plateau and has seen little change during its evolution so far. When stars ascend the giant branch, they largely do so along tracks of constant $\alpha$, with $\alpha$ decreasing with increasing mass.},

@article{Deheuvels2011,
abstract = {Context. The solar-like pulsator HD 49385 was observed with the CoRoT satellite over a period of 137 days. The analysis of its oscillation spectrum yielded precise estimates of the mode frequencies over nine radial orders and distinguished some unusual characteristics, such as some modes outside the identified ridges in the {\'{e}}chelle diagram and that the curvature of the ℓ = 1 ridge differs significantly from that of the ℓ = 0 ridge. Aims: We search for stellar models that can reproduce the peculiar features of the oscillation spectrum of HD 49385. After showing that they can be accounted for only by a low-frequency ℓ = 1 avoided crossing, we investigate the information provided by the mixed modes about the structure of the core of HD 49385. Methods: We propose a toy-model to study the case of avoided crossings with a strong coupling between the p-mode and g-mode cavities in order to establish the presence of mixed modes in the spectrum of HD 49385. We then show that traditional optimization techniques are ill-suited to stars with mixed modes in avoided crossing. We propose a new approach to the computation of grids of models that we apply to HD 49385. Results: The detection of mixed modes leads us to establish the post-main-sequence status of HD 49385. The mixed mode frequencies suggest that there is a strong coupling between the p-mode and g-mode cavities. As a result, we show that the amount of core overshooting in HD 49385 is either very small (0 {\textless} $\alpha$ov {\textless} 0.05) or moderate (0.18 {\textless} $\alpha$ov {\textless} 0.20). The mixing length parameter is found to be significantly lower than the solar one ($\alpha$CGM = 0.55 ± 0.04 compared to the solar value $\alpha$sun = 0.64). Finally, we show that the revised solar abundances of Asplund ensure closer agreement with the observations than the classical ones of Grevesse {\&} Noels. At each step, we investigate the origin and meaning of these seismic diagnostics in terms of the physical structure of the star. Conclusions: The subgiant HD 49385 is the first star for which a thorough modeling has been attempted to reproduce all the properties of an avoided crossing. It has provided the opportunity to show that the study of the coupling between the cavities in these stars can provide valuable insight into open questions such as core overshooting, the efficiency of convection, and the abundances of heavy elements in stars.},

@article{Nordstrom2004,
abstract = {Context: Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of stars in the Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of galactic disk evolution. Understanding and minimising systematic errors and sample selection biases in the data is crucial for their interpretation. Aims: We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvby$\beta$ photometry into T{\_}eff, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstr{\"{o}}m et al. 2004; GCS) in terms of the evolution of the disk. Methods: We use recent V-K photometry, angular diameters, high-resolution spectroscopy, Hipparcos parallaxes, and extensive numerical simulations to re-examine and verify the temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening calibrations for the uvby$\beta$ system. We also highlight the selection effects inherent in the apparent-magnitude limited GCS sample. Results: We substantially improve the T{\_}eff and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars, where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. A slight offset of the GCS photometry and the non-standard helium abundance of the Hyades invalidate its use for checking metallicity or age scales; however, the distances, reddenings, metallicities, and age scale for GCS field stars require minor corrections only. Our recomputed ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined. Conclusions: The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages ($\sigma${\_}intrinsic = 0.20 dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life; specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

Its interaction with the nearby environment, comprised of clusters of evolved and young stars, a molecular dusty ring, ionized gas streamers, diffuse hot gas, and a hypernova remnant, is providing a wealth of accretion phenomenology and high-energy processes for detailed modeling.

@article{Magic2013,
abstract = {Aims: We present the Stagger-grid, a comprehensive grid of time-dependent, three-dimensional (3D), hydrodynamic model atmospheres for late-type stars with realistic treatment of radiative transfer, covering a wide range in stellar parameters. This grid of 3D models is intended for various applications besides studies of stellar convection and atmospheres per se, including stellar parameter determination, stellar spectroscopy and abundance analysis, asteroseismology, calibration of stellar evolution models, interferometry, and extrasolar planet search. In this introductory paper, we describe the methods we applied for the computation of the grid and discuss the general properties of the 3D models as well as of their temporal and spatial averages (here denoted ⟨3D⟩ models). Methods: All our models were generated with the Stagger-code, using realistic input physics for the equation of state (EOS) and for continuous and line opacities. Our {\~{}} 220 grid models range in effective temperature, Teff, from 4000 to 7000 K in steps of 500 K, in surface gravity, log g, from 1.5 to 5.0 in steps of 0.5 dex, and metallicity, [Fe/H], from - 4.0 to + 0.5 in steps of 0.5 and 1.0 dex. Results: We find a tight scaling relation between the vertical velocity and the surface entropy jump, which itself correlates with the constant entropy value of the adiabatic convection zone. The range in intensity contrast is enhanced at lower metallicity. The granule size correlates closely with the pressure scale height sampled at the depth of maximum velocity. We compare the ⟨3D⟩ models with currently widely applied one-dimensional (1D) atmosphere models, as well as with theoretical 1D hydrostatic models generated with the same EOS and opacity tables as the 3D models, in order to isolate the effects of using self-consistent and hydrodynamic modeling of convection, rather than the classical mixing length theory approach. For the first time, we are able to quantify systematically over a broad range of stellar parameters the uncertainties of 1D models arising from the simplified treatment of physics, in particular convective energy transport. In agreement with previous findings, we find that the differences can be rather significant, especially for metal-poor stars.},

A method of univariate interpolation having the accuracy of a third-degree polynomial while retaining the desired properties of the method developed earlier by Akima ( J .

The newly developed method is based on a piecewise function composed of a set of polynomials, each of (at most) degree three, and applicable to successive intervals of the given data points. The method estimates the first derivative of the interpolating function (or the slope of the curve) at each given data point from the coordinates of seven data points. The resultant curve looks natural in many cases when the method is applied to curve fitting. The method is presented with examples. The possible use of a higher-degree polynomial in each interval is also examined.},

abstract = {We present the results of the asteroseismic analysis of the red-giant star KIC 4351319 (TYC 3124-914-1), observed for 30 days in short-cadence mode with the Kepler satellite. The analysis has allowed us to determine the large and small frequency separations, and the frequency of maximum oscillation power. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the observations allowed us to identify 25 independent pulsation modes whose frequencies range approximately from 300 to 500 muHz. The observed oscillation frequencies together with the accurate determination of the atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, gravity and metallicity), provided by additional ground-based spectroscopic observations, enabled us to theoretically interpret the observed oscillation spectrum. KIC 4351319 appears to oscillate with a well defined solar-type p-modes pattern due to radial acoustic modes and non-radial nearly pure p modes. In addition, several non-radial mixed modes have been identified. Theoretical models well reproduce the observed oscillation frequencies and indicate that this star, located at the base of the ascending red-giant branch, is in the hydrogen-shell burning phase, with a mass of about 1.3 solar masses, a radius of about 3.4 solar radii and an age of about 5.6 Gyr. The main parameters of this star have been determined with an unprecedent level of precision for a red-giant star, with uncertainties of 2{\%} for mass, 7{\%} for age, 1{\%} for radius, and 4{\%} for luminosity.},

The Galaxy is a luminous (L?) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated “green valley” region of the galaxy colour-magnitude dia- gram.

abstract = {Differences between observed and theoretical eigenfrequencies of the Sun have characteristics which identify them as arising predominantly from properties of the oscillations in the vicinity of the solar surface: in the super-adiabatic, convective boundary layer and above. These frequency differences may therefore provide useful information about the structure of these regions, precisely where the theory of solar structure is most uncertain. In the present work we use numerical simulations of the outer part of the Sun to quantify the influence of turbulent convection on solar oscillation frequencies. Separating the influence into effects on the mean model and effects on the physics of the modes, we find that the main model effects are due to the turbulent pressure that provides additional support against gravity, and thermal differences between average 3-D models and 1-D models. Surfaces of constant pressure in the visible photosphere are elevated by about 150 km, relative to a standard envelope model. As a result, the turning points of high-frequency modes are raised, while those of the low-frequency modes remain essentially unaffected. The corresponding gradual lowering of the mode frequencies accounts for most of the frequency difference between observations and standard solar models. Additional effects are expected to come primarily from changes in the physics of the modes, in particular from the modulation of the turbulent pressure by the oscillations.},

abstract = {We present a new method, using Bayesian estimation, to determine stellar ages and their uncertainties from observational data and theoretical isochrones. The result for an individual star is obtained as the relative posterior probability density as function of the age (“G function”). From this can be derived the most probable age and confidence intervals. The convoluted morphology of isochrones and strong non-linearities make the age determination by any method difficult and susceptible to statistical biases, and as a result age uncertainties havee often been underestimated in the literature. From simulations we find that the G functions provide a general, robust and reliable way to quantify age information. Resulting age estimates are at least as accurate as those obtained with conventional isochrone fitting methods, and in some cases much better, especially when the observational uncertainties are large. We also find that undetected binaries, on the whole, have a surprisingly small effect on the age determinations. For a stellar sample, the individual G functions can be combined to derive the star formation history of the population; this will be developed in a forthcoming paper. For a coeval population the combination simplifies to computing the product of the individual G functions, and we apply that method to estimate the ages of the two open clusters IC 4651 and M 67, using Padova isochrones and photometric data from the literature. For IC 4651 we find an estimated age of 1.56± 0.03 Gyr, assuming a true distance modulus of 9.80. For M 67 we find 4.05± 0.05 Gyr for true distance modulus 9.48. The small formal errors of these age estimates do not include the (much larger) uncertainties from calibration and model errors, but illustrate the statistical power of combining G functions. Our statistical approach to the age determination problem is well suited for the mass treatment of data resulting from large-scale surveys such as the Gaia mission.},

abstract = {We investigate the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR) of a sample of 30 quasars in the redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, by using near-IR and optical spectra. We focus on the ratio of the broad lines (SiIV1397+OIV]1402)/CIV1549, which is a good metallicity tracer of the BLR. We find that the metallicity of the BLR is very high even in QSOs at z{\~{}}6. The inferred metallicity of the BLR gas is so high (several times solar) that metal ejection or mixing with lower metallicity gas in the host galaxy is required to match the metallicities observed in local massive galaxies. On average, the observed metallicity changes neither among quasars in the observed redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, nor when compared with quasars at lower redshifts. We show that the apparent lack of metallicity evolution is a likely consequence of both the black hole-galaxy co-evolution and of selection effects. The data also suggest a lack of evolution in the carbon abundance, even among z{\textgreater}6 quasars. The latter result is puzzling, since the minimum enrichment timescale of carbon is about 1 Gyr, i.e. longer than the age of the universe at z{\~{}}6.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Using the code AUTOSTRUCTURE, extensive calculations of inner-shell atomic data have been made for the chemical elements He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni. The results are used to obtain up-dated opacities from the Opacity Project, OP. A number of other improvements on earlier work have also been included.   Rosseland-mean opacities from OP are compared with those from OPAL. Differences of 5 to 10{\%} occur. OP gives the `Z-bump', at log(T)=5.2, to be shifted to slightly higher temperatures. The opacities from OP, as functions of temperature and density, are smoother than those from OPAL. Extensive tests show that the numerical accuracy of the OP opacities following integration over frequency mesh and interpolation on temperature-density mesh is better than 1{\%}.   Prior to a number of recent investigations which have indicated a need for a downward revision in the solar abundances of oxygen and other elements, there was good agreement between properties of the sun deduced from helioseismology and from stellar evolution models calculated using OPAL opacities. The revisions in abundances destroy that agreement. In a recent paper Bahcall et al argue that the agreement would be restored if opacities for the regions of the sun between 0.7 and 0.4 solar radii were larger than those given by OPAL by about 10{\%}. In the region concerned, the present results from OP do not differ from those of OPAL by more than 2.5{\%}.},

It is dedicated to seismology and detection of telluric planets. In both domains it is a precursor and a pathfinder. Though the programmatic framework imposes quite strong limitations, it is possible to perform both a seismology and an exoplanet finder programme of prime scientific interest. We recall here the scientific specifications, written first in 1998 and upgraded till 2002, which have driven the concept of the instrument and its realisation. The knowledge on ultra-high precision photometry from space acquired in building CoRoT, and its scientific results, will certainly be very helpful in the definition and preparation of the next generation missions.},

We also derive the mass mixing length, {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}m, and the vertical correlation length of the vertical velocity, C[v{\_}z,v{\_}z], directly from the 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar subsurface convection. The calibrated mixing length parameter for the Sun is {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}MLT (s{\_}bot) = 1.98. For different stellar parameters, {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}MLT varies systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4.

We find equivalent results for {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}MLT ({\{}$\backslash$Delta{\}}s). Also, we find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from the hydrodynamic mean field equations that motivates the relation to the mass mixing length, {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}m, and find that it exhibits qualitatively a similar variation with stellar parameter (between 1.6 and 2.4) with a solar value of {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}m = 1.83. The vertical correlation length scaled with the pressure scale height yields for the Sun 1.71, but displays only a small systematic variation with stellar parameters, the correlation length slightly increasing with Teff. We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar parameters that can be used to replace a constant value.

abstract = {We present a new method for replacing the outermost layers of stellar models with interpolated atmospheres based on results from 3D simulations, in order to correct for structural inadequacies of these layers. This replacement is known as patching. Tests, based on 3D atmospheres from three different codes and interior models with different input physics, are performed. Using solar models, we investigate how different patching criteria affect the eigenfrequencies. These criteria include the depth, at which the replacement is performed, the quantity, on which the replacement is based, and the mismatch in {\$}T{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashlog g{\$} between the un-patched model and patched 3D atmosphere. We find the eigenfrequencies to be unaltered by the patching depth deep within the adiabatic region, while changing the patching quantity or the employed atmosphere grid leads to frequency shifts that may exceed {\$}1\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashmathrm{\{}Hz{\}}{\$}. Likewise, the eigenfrequencies are sensitive to mismatches in {\$}T{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\$} or {\$}\backslashlog g{\$}. A thorough investigation of the accuracy of a new scheme, for interpolating mean 3D stratifications within the atmosphere grids, is furthermore performed. Throughout large parts of the atmosphere grids, our interpolation scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the purpose of asteroseismology. We apply our procedure in asteroseismic analyses of four $\backslash$textit{\{}Kepler{\}} stars and draw the same conclusions as in the solar case: Correcting for structural deficiencies lowers the eigenfrequencies, this correction is slightly sensitive to the patching criteria, and the remaining frequency discrepancy between models and observations is less frequency-dependent. Our work shows the applicability and relevance of patching in asteroseismology.},

abstract = {By considering stellar models with the same interior structure but different outer layers we demonstrate that the ratio of the small to large separations of acoustic oscillations in solar-like stars is essentially independent of the structure of the outer layers, and is determined solely by the interior structure. Defining the scaled Eulerian pressure perturbation $\psi$ ($\omega$, t) = rp /($\rho$c) 1/2 we define the internal phase shift $\delta$ ($\omega$, t) through the relation $\omega$$\psi$/(d$\psi$/dt) = tan($\omega$t − $\pi$$\pi$/2 + $\delta$). The $\delta$ are almost independent of acoustic radius t = dr/c outside the stellar core and can be determined as a continuous functions of $\omega$ from partial wave solutions for the interior – that is solutions of the oscillation equations for any $\omega$ that satisfy the Laplace boundary condition at a sufficiently large acoustic radius t f outside the stellar core. If the $\omega$ are eigenfrequencies then they satisfy the Eigenfrequency Equation $\omega$T = (n + /2)$\pi$ + $\alpha$($\omega$) − $\delta$ ($\omega$) where $\alpha$($\omega$) is the independent surface phase shift (Roxburgh {\&} Vorontsov 2000). Using this result we show that the ratio of small to large separations is determined to high accuracy solely by the internal phase shifts $\delta$ ($\omega$) and hence by the interior structure alone. The error in this result is estimated and shown to be smaller than that associated with the errors in the determination of the frequencies (≈0.1–0.3 µHz) from the upcoming space missions MOST, COROT and Eddington.},

Internal partition functions are truncated using an occupation probability formalism that accounts for perturbations of bound states by both neutral and charged perturbers. The entire theory is analytical and differentiable to all orders, so it is possible to write explicit analytical formulas for all derivatives required in a Newton-Raphson iteration; these are presented to facilitate future work. Some representative results for both Saha and free-energy-minimization equilibria are presented for a hydrogen-helium plasma with N(He)/N(H) = 0.10.

We then outline the range of star-forming environments that are available in the Galaxy and discuss how they affect star and planet formation. The nature of the solar birth cluster is constrained by many physical considerations, including radiation fields provided by the background environment, dynamical scattering interactions, and by the necessity of producing the short-lived radioactive nuclear species inferred from meteoritic measurements.

Convection in a strongly stratified medium has: (1) gentle expanding structureless warm upflows and (2) strong converging filamentary cool downdrafts. The horizontal flow topology is cellular, with a hierarchy of cell sizes. The small density scale height in the surface layers forces the formation of the solar granulation, which is a shallow surface phenomenon. Deeper layers support successively larger cells. The downflows of small cells close to the surface merge into filamentary downdrafts of larger cells at greater depths, and this process is likely to continue through most of the convection zone.

The convolutional neural network additionally shows capability in accurately predicting the evolutionary states of 5379 previously unclas-sified Kepler red giants, by which we now have greatly increased the number of classified stars.},

We then present new determinations of the electron-conduction opacity in stellar conditions for an arbitrary chemical composition that improve over previous works and, most importantly, cover the whole parameter space relevant to stellar evolution models (i.e., both the regime of partial and high electron degeneracy). A detailed comparison with the currently used tabulations is also performed. The impact of our new opacities on the evolution of low-mass stars is assessed by computing stellar models along both the H- and He-burning evolutionary phases, as well as main sequence models of very low-mass stars and white dwarf cooling tracks.},

@article{Ball2014,
abstract = {Context. Space-based observations of solar-like oscillations present an opportunity to constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic difference that must be corrected. Aims: We introduce and evaluate two parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough (1990, LNP, 367, 283). The first we call a cubic term proportional to $\nu$3/ ℐ and the second has an additional inverse term proportional to $\nu$-1/ ℐ, where $\nu$ and ℐ are the frequency and inertia of an oscillation mode. Methods: We first show that these formulae accurately correct model frequencies of two different solar models (Model S and a calibrated MESA model) when compared to observed BiSON frequencies. In particular, even the cubic form alone fits significantly better than a power law. We then incorporate the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations of the well-studied CoRoT target HD 52265. For comparison, we also run the pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L175). Results: The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for HD 52265 are consistent with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is significantly worse but yields consistent parameters, suggesting that HD 52265 is sufficiently Sun-like for the same power-law to be applicable. Conclusions: We find that the cubic term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to implement in an existing pipeline. It reproduces the frequency dependence of the surface correction better than a power-law fit, both when comparing calibrated solar models to BiSON observations and when fitting stellar models using the individual frequencies. This parametrization is thus a useful new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode frequencies can be exploited.},

@article{Rogers1996,
abstract = {OPAL opacities have recently helped to resolve a number of long-standing discrepancies between theory and observation. This success has made it important to provide the associated equation-of-state (EOS) data. The OPAL EOS is based on an activity expansion of the grand canonical partition function of the plasma in terms of its fundamental constituents (electrons and nuclei). The formation of composite particles and many- body effects on the internal bound states occur naturally in this approach. Hence, pressure ionization is a consequence of the theory. In contrast, commonly used approaches, all of which are based on minimization of free energy, are forced to assert the effect of the plasma on composite particles and must rely on an ad hoc treatment of pressure ionization. Another advantage of the OPAL approach is that it provides a systematic expansion in the Coulomb coupling parameter that includes subtle quantum effects generally not considered in other EOS calculations. Tables have been generated that provide pressure, internal energy, entropy, and a variety of derivative quantities. These tables cover a fairly broad range of conditions and compositions applicable to general stellar-evolution calculations for stars more massive than ˜0.8 Msun. An interpolation code is provided along with the tables to facilitate their use.},

@article{Serenelli2013,
abstract = {For studies of Galactic evolution, the accurate characterization of stars in terms of their evolutionary stage and population membership is of fundamental importance. A standard approach relies on extracting this information from stellar evolution models but requires the effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity of a star obtained by independent means. In previous work, we determined accurate effective temperatures and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium log g and [Fe/H] (NLTE-Opt) for a large sample of metal-poor stars, -3 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} -0.5, selected from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey. As a continuation of that work, we derive here their masses, ages and distances using a Bayesian scheme and GARSTEC stellar tracks. For comparison, we also use stellar parameters determined from the widely used 1D LTE excitation-ionization balance of Fe (LTE-Fe). We find that the latter leads to systematically underestimated stellar ages, by 10-30 per cent, but overestimated masses and distances. Metal-poor giants suffer from the largest fractional distance biases of 70 per cent. Furthermore, we compare our results with those released by the RAVE collaboration (DR3) for the stars in common. This reveals -400 to +400 K offsets in effective temperature, -0.5 to 1 dex offsets in surface gravity and 10 to 70 per cent in distances. The systematic trends strongly resemble the correlation we find between the NLTE-Opt and LTE-Fe parameters, indicating that the RAVE DR3 data may be affected by the physical limitations of the 1D LTE synthetic spectra. Our results bear on any study, where spectrophotometric distances underlie stellar kinematics. In particular, they shed new light on the debated controversy about the Galactic halo origin raised by the SDSS/SEGUE observations.},

A blind analysis avoids the possibility of experimenters biasing their result toward their own preconceptions by preventing them from knowing the answer until the analysis is complete. There is at least circumstantial evidence that such a bias has affected past measurements, and as experiments have become costlier and more difficult and hence harder to reproduce, the possibility of bias has become a more important issue than in the past. We describe here the motivations for performing a blind analysis, and give several modern examples of successful blind analysis strategies.},

Using available $\backslash$Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we create power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging'' using a Bayesian MCMC framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from LTE whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

Our aim is to use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores in a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for having a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that was proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores using the so-called {\$}r{\_}{\{}010{\}}{\$} ratios, which are built with {\$}l=0{\$} and {\$}l=1{\$} modes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute grids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where the extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous mixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to unambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good agreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of extra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic observations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose a calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription chosen for the extra-mixing, but we find that it should be valid also for the code MESA, provided the same prescription is used. This study constitutes a first step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in low-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these stars.},
