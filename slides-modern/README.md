# Slides with beamer -- modern theme

Slides using the `beamer` documentclass and the `metropolis` theme. The best
results is obtained with `luatex` and the Fira Sans font family, however
`pdftex` is supported as well (the preamble will automatically detect which is
used). 

To create handout-notes, simply activate the corresponding switch in the code.
