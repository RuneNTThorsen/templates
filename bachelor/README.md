# Template for a BSc project

Suitable for a Bachelor's project (with strict 30 pages limit). Uses will
conserve space by removing black pages and place new chapters on any page.

Tip for nice compilation:
```
latexmk -pvc bsc_master.tex
```

Change the `latexmkrc`-file if you need `shell-escape` for code-inclusion with
the `minted` package.
