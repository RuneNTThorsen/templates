# Templates for LaTeX

Template for various purposes. The most relevant are *bachelor* and *thesis*,
which are templates designed for the corresponding projects in
Physics/Astronomy/Maths/Nanoscience/Computer Science at Aarhus University.

## Troubleshooting
In some cases the LaTeX compiler fails on the font *"libertinust1math"* (if the
installed TeX Live is quite old). Unless you want to update your installation
(which you of course should!), then swap the line `\usepackage{libertinust1math}`
with `\usepackage[libertine]{newtxmath}` in the preamble.
